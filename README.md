# CSCI1230 Final Project: Fractal Generation

Team: No Preference

Members: Nathan Plano, Nick Huang, Richard Tang (rtang26)

The project- We created a CPU raymarching engine that can render differnt objects based on a distance field. The objects that have been created are the follwing 

1. sphere
2. Procedural Terrain 
3. Mandelbulbs 
4. Fractal Trees
5. Planes 



How to use-

We implemented our UI using the TA stencil code. If you navigate to shapes/sceneview tab on the UI you will see 7 differnt types of scenes. Sphere, mandelbulb 1, mandelbulb 2, Fractal Tree, and Epic Scene1 2 and 3.  Each of these will render a different scene. The fractal depth tabs can be used when rendering the mandelbulb 1 and mandelbulb2 scenese to see differnt mandelbulbs. The Fractal parameters for the tree is height width and fractal depth of the tree. These can be toggled to get good images. Finally our epic scenes will be just cool scenese that would put together for you to see. Also we controlled shadows, reflective and refractive charaterstics of objecrs.
